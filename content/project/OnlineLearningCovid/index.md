With disease outcomes constantly being impacted by virus variants, enhanced treatments, and widespread vaccination, the fast-changing COVID-19 pandemic demands adaptability in prognostic systems. This paper presents an online deep-learning-based framework for predicting severe disease outcomes (including intensive care unit [ICU] admission and death) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The proposed framework starts with an initial prognostic model based on an artificial neural network and continues to update it using data from new patients. We applied our framework on a dataset of 595 patients collected over 16 months. We developed an initial model using 4 months of data, and then retrospectively evaluated it in an online fashion using the data over a 1-year period. Our method achieved an AUC of 0.762 in predicting severe outcomes, 7% better than existing COVID-19 prognostic methods and 6% better than benchmark online-learning methods. The obtained prediction accuracy is also superior to that of model retraining.

title: Real-world Faults and Their Injection into Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
summary:  In this paper, we perform (i) an assessment of field failure reports from four multi-national databases relating to safety incidents involving UAVs; and (ii) inspired by the failure study, we demonstrate the use of a simple fault injection framework, UAVFI, to demonstrate the impact of a few key-faults on the performance and failures of UAVs in photo-realistic simulated environments.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being rapidly deployed in many real-world applications, such as policing, logistics, search, aerial-survey, and filming. However, recent headline-making UAV accidents highlight the challenge of ensuring the safety of such cyber-physical systems. Hence, a methodology for the meticulous safety assessment of UAVs is a primary concern for developing such technology, directly influencing its public acceptance and adoption. In this paper, we perform (i) an assessment of field failure reports from four multi-national databases relating to safety incidents involving UAVs; and (ii)
inspired by the failure study, we demonstrate the use of a simple fault injection framework, UAVFI, to demonstrate the impact of a
few key-faults on the performance and failures of UAVs in photo-realistic simulated environments. We draw several conclusions. For example, we observe that a only 8.1% of real-world accidents in UAVs are caused by computer/software malfunctions. Fault models dealing with sensor and mechanical failures are key in developing reliable UAV systems. UAVFI can leverage such insight to create fault injection campaigns that cause as much as 75.9% increase in mission completion time, as well as 3.5Ã— increase in accident incidence.
